A group project for University of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp.

<h1> brewFinder Purpose</h1>

The purpose of brewFinder is to locate local microbreweries based on the user's input of a valid zip code. brewFinder also displays 
the temperature of the closest weather station based on the zip code. Not only does brewFinder show the local micobreweries, and temperature 
based on zip code, but if the user clicks on one of the beer stein flags basic information for that brewery will appear. The user will see
the brewery's address and Google rating.

We hope that users find this app useful, and use it as a one-stop-shop for weather and local microbreweries. 

<h1>How To</h1>

If you are using our app, here are some simple and quick instructions to get the best results:
<ul>Landing page tells the user what we do, and also has you answer a question, "Are you 21?" click yes or no depending on the user's age.</ul>
<ul>If the user is not 21, they will be brought to a more appropriate site - Wiki's Shirley Temple (drink) page.</ul>
<ul>If the user is over 21, they will be brought to brewFinder's results html page.</ul>
<ul>Enter a valid zip code in the desginated area.</ul>
<ul>An invalid zip code will result in the page not running.</ul>
<ul> A valid zip code will result in the temperature and a map with pindrops of local microbreweries.</ul>
